T:Intro/coda (play before verse 1 and 3)
T:He'd play one hymn for the ladies, one for the men then he would turn right around, and play them both again when they all got to singin', and clappin' hands he had the swinginest congregation in the land
T:When the sermon was over, he'd leave the town and travel on to the next to lay his gospel down So bow your heads and we'll join in one mighty chord to say a prayer for the preacher gone to his reward
