T:Almost persuaded, come, come today; Almost persuaded, turn not away. Jesus invites you here, Angels are lingering near, Prayers rise from hearts so dear, O wanderer, come. Almost persuaded, harvest is past; Almost persuaded, doom comes at last. Almost cannot avail, Almost is sure to fail, Sad, sad, that bitter wail, Almost-but lost.
