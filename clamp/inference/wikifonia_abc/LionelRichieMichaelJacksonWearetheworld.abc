T:There comes a time when we heed a certain call When the world must come together as one There are people dying & its time to lend a hand to life	There greatest gift of all We can't go on pretending day by day That someone, somewhere will soon make a change We are all a part of Gods great big family & the truth, you know,	Love is all we need We are the world, we are the children We are the ones who make a brighter day So let's start giving There's a choice we're making	We're saving our own lives It's true we'll make a better day	Just you & me Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares & their lives will be stronger & free As God has shown us by turning stones to bread So we all must lend a helping hand 		 REF When you're down & out, there seems no hope at all But if you just believe there's no way we can fall Let us realize that a change can only come,   When we stand together as one
