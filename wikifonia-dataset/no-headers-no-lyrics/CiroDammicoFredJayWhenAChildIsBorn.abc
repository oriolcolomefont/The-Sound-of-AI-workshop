 G E D C"_A silent wish sails the seven seas,\nThe winds of change whisper in the trees\nAnd the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn\nThis comes to pass, when a child is born.\n\nA rosy hue settles all around,\nYou get the feel you're on solid ground,\nFor a spell or two no one seems forlorn\nThis comes to pass when a child is born.\n\nAnd all of this happens because the world is waiting,\nWaiting for one child\nBlack, white, yellow, no-one knows\nBut a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter,\nHate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbour\nAnd misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever\n\nIt's all a dream, an illusion now.\nIt must come true sometime soon somehow.\nAll across the land dawns a brand new morn -\nThis comes to pass when a child is born" | %13
